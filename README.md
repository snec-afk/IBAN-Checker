# IBAN-Checker
Hello, 
As you can see, the language of choice for this assignment was Python. 
I used a standard tkinter GUI.

check_iban class tests whether or not the code is at least 20 digits long then checks which bank group it belongs to; if it passes, it outputs the information 
into the textbox and writes into a .csv file.
open_file class allows you to choose any text file on your computer and it reads it line by line, 
whilst checking whether or not the code is correct and which bank group it belongs to. Same principle as the 1st class.

I have ommitted the .csv file code purely so it would be easier to read and inspect the code
but it would work the same way as the 1st class if needed.

I focused on the functionality of the assignment rather than the looks, although if needed, it could be styled 
however for the sake of time I have also chose to omit that from this assignment.

Please get in touch if you have any questions about any parts of the code or the application/design choices.
